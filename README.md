# Quiz App

The **Quiz App** is a simple Python application designed to provide an interactive quiz experience. Users can take quizzes, view their scores, and track high scores.

## Purpose

The purpose behind creating this script is to enhance Python programming skills, particularly in handling user inputs, managing data structures, and developing basic command-line interfaces. This app is created as part of learning and practicing Python during my data science education at EC Utbildning (2022-2024).
